## Prerequisites

* Maven
* Firefox browser installed


> ###Disclaimer###
>Please note that this is just a proof of concept. Code requires several improvements and a different aproach for a real use.
This is a completely ad-hoc example that may not work with future facebook HTML changes or either in different browsers as it has only been tested on Mozilla Firefox (12/01/2015)
